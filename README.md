## I lost my data scientist lab coat in a house fire and without it I am unable to do college basic math so guess I have to find new ways to make an A.I trader bot.

 - ### 5GB of price historical data of cryptocurrencys prices and volumes
 - ### Some great computation power with an NVIDIA 1070 GPU and CUDA
 - ### MonteCarlo algorithms

## First I take a chart, then parse the 100M other charts in the data and find matchs:

## Then I look what happened in the futur of the match and try to find redundant pattern to define the bot strategy.

Spoiler, it does not work at all, the futur of the match are totaly random, maybe cryptocurrency prices aren't predictible without a college degree
